Don’t flash an immediate smile when you greet someone, as though anyone who walked into your line of sight would be the beneficiary. Instead, look at the other person’s face for a second. Pause. Soak in their persona. Then let a big, warm, responsive smile flood over your face and overflow into your eyes. It will engulf the recipient like a warm wave. The split-second delay convinces people your flooding smile is genuine and only for them.

Pivoting 100 per cent toward New Person shouts ‘I think you are very, very special.’

Professional communicators are alert to this hazard. They consciously squelch any signs anyone could mistake for shiftiness. They fix a constant gaze on their listener. They never put their hands on their faces. They don’t massage their arm when it tingles, or rub their nose when it itches. They don’t loosen their collar when it’s hot or blink because it’s sandy. They don’t wipe away tiny perspiration beads in public or shield their eyes from the sun. They suffer because they know fidgeting undermines credibility.

Whenever your conversation really counts, let your nose itch, your ear tingle, or your foot prickle. Do not fidget, twitch, wiggle, squirm, or scratch. And above all, keep your paws away from your face. Hand motions near your face and all fidgeting can give your listener the gut feeling you’re fibbing.

Before opening your mouth, take a ‘voice sample’ of your listener to detect his or her state of mind. Take a ‘psychic photograph’ of the expression to see if your listener looks buoyant, bored, or blitzed. If you ever want to bring people around to your thoughts, you must match their mood and voice tone, if only for a moment.

When asked the inevitable ‘And what do YOU do,’ you may think ‘I’m an economist,’ ‘an educator,’ ‘an engineer’ is giving enough information to engender good conversation.

Encore! is the name of the technique you can use to request a repeat story from a prospect, potential employer, or valued acquaintance. While the two of you are chatting with a group of people, simply turn to him and say, ‘John, I bet everyone would love to hear about the time you caught that thirty-pound striped bass.’ Or, ‘Susan, tell everyone that story you just told me of how you rescued the kitten from the tree.’ He or she will, of course, demur. Insist! Your Conversation Partner is secretly loving it. The subtext of your request is ‘That story of yours was so terrific, I want my other friends to hear it.’

When first meeting someone, lock your closet door and save your skeletons for later. You and your new good friend can invite the skeletons out, have a good laugh, and dance over their bones later in the relationship. But now’s the time, as the old song says, to ‘ac-cen-tu-ate the pos-i-tive and elim-i-nate the neg-a-tive.’

The last move to make before leaving for the party – even after you’ve given yourself final approval in the mirror – is to turn on the radio news or scan your newspaper. Anything that happened today is good material. Knowing the big-deal news of the moment is also a defensive move that rescues you from putting your foot in your mouth by asking what everybody’s talking about. Foot-in-mouth is not very tasty in public, especially when it’s surrounded by egg-on-face.

Look up some common words you use every day in the thesaurus. Then, like slipping your feet into a new pair of shoes, slip your tongue into a few new words to see how they fit. If you like them, start making permanent replacements. Remember, only fifty words makes the difference between a rich, creative vocabulary and an average, middle-of-the-road one. Substitute a word a day for two months and you’ll be in the verbally elite.

Start every appropriate sentence with YOU. It immediately grabs your listener’s attention.

Many speakers use author’s and speaker’s agent Lilly Walters’s face-saver lines from her book, What to Say When You’re Dying on the Platform.16 If you tell a joke and no one laughs, try ‘That joke was designed to get a silent laugh – and it worked.’ If the microphone lets out an agonizing howl, look at it and say, ‘I don’t understand. I brushed my teeth this morning.’ If someone asks you a question you don’t want to answer, ‘Could you save that question until I’m finished – and well on my way home?’ All pros think of holes they might fall into and then memorize great escape lines. You can do the same.

Whether you’re standing behind a podium facing thousands, or behind the barbecue grill facing your family, you’ll move, amuse, and motivate with the same skills.

If you want to be notable, dream up a crazy quotable. Make ’em rhyme, make ’em clever, or make ’em funny. Above all, make ’em relevant.

Don’t be an unconscious ummer. Vocalize complete sentences to show your understanding. Dust your dialogue with phrases like ‘I see what you mean.’ Sprinkle it with sentimental sparklers like ‘That’s a lovely thing to say.’ Your empathy impresses your listeners and encourages them to continue. Of course, you pay a price. In order to use the right empathizers, you do need to listen.

What part of their anatomy are your associates talking though? Their eyes? Their ears? Their gut? For visual people, use visual empathizers to make them think you see the world the way they do. For auditory folks, use auditory empathizers to make them think you hear them loud and clear. For kinesthetic types, use kinesthetic empathizers to make them think you feel the same way they do.

When you meet a stranger you’d like to make less a stranger, search for some special moment you shared during your first encounter. Then find a few words that reprieve the laugh, the warm smile, the good feelings the two of you felt. Now, just like old friends, you have a history together, an Instant History.

Instead of telling someone directly of your admiration, tell someone who is close to the person you wish to compliment. For instance, suppose you want to be in the good graces of Jane Smith. Don’t directly compliment Jane. Go to her close associate Diane Doe and say, ‘You know, Jane is a very dynamic woman. She said something so brilliant in the meeting the other day. Someday she’ll be running this company.’ I place ten-to-one odds your comment will get back to Jane via the grapevine in twenty-four hours. Diane will tell her friend, ‘You should hear what so ’n’ so said about you the other day.’

Ask the important people in your life what they would like engraved on their tombstone. Chisel it into your memory but don’t mention it again. Then, when the moment is right to say ‘I appreciate you’ or ‘I love you,’ fill the blanks with the very words they gave you weeks earlier. You take people’s breath away when you feed their deepest self-image to them in a compliment. ‘At last,’ they say to themselves, ‘someone who loves me for who I truly am.’

People perk up when they hear their own name. Use it more often on the phone than you would in person to keep their attention. Your caller’s name re-creates the eye contact, the caress, you might give in person. Saying someone’s name repeatedly when face-to-face sounds pandering. But because there is physical distance between you on the phone – sometimes you’re a continent apart – you can spray your conversation with it.

Be a human magnet, not a human repellant. When standing at a gathering, arrange your body in an open position – especially your arms and hands. People instinctively gravitate toward open palms and wrists seductively arranged in the ‘come hither’ position. They shy away from knuckles in the ‘get lost or I’ll punch you’ position. Use your wrists and palms to say ‘I have nothing to hide,’ ‘I accept you and what you’re saying,’ or ‘I find you sexy.’

Like an air-traffic controller, track the tiniest details of your Conversation Partners’ lives. Refer to them in your conversation like a major news story. It creates a powerful sense of intimacy. When you envoke the last major or minor event in anyone’s life, it confirms the deep conviction that he or she is an old-style hero around whom the world revolves. And people love you for recognizing their stardom.

Right after you’ve talked to someone at a party, take out your pen. On the back of his or her business card write notes to remind you of the conversation: his favourite restaurant, sport, film, or drink; whom she admires, where she grew up, a high school honour; or maybe a joke he told. In your next communication, toss off a reference to the favourite restaurant, film, movie, drink, hometown, high school prize. Or reprieve the laugh over the great joke.

Whenever someone’s story is aborted, let the interruption play itself out. Give everyone time to dote on the little darling, give their dinner order, or pick up the jagged pieces of china. Then, when the group reassembles, simply say to the person who suffered story-interruptus, ‘Now please get back to your story.’ Or better yet, remember where they were and then ask, ‘So what happened after the … (and fill in the last few words.)’

There are three sacred safe havens in the human jungle where even the toughest tiger knows he must not attack. The first of these is parties. Parties are for pleasantries and good fellowship, not for confrontations. Big Players, even when standing next to their enemies at the buffet table, smile and nod. They leave tough talk for tougher settings.

The most guarded safe haven respected by Big Winners is the dining table. Breaking bread together is a time when they bring up no unpleasant matters. While eating, they know it’s OK to brainstorm and discuss the positive side of the business: their dreams, their desires, their designs. They can free associate and come up with new ideas. But no tough business. This convention probably arose out of a prudent agreement not to inflict indigestion on each other. Tough negotiating is unpalatable and can ruin an otherwise perfectly mouthwatering veal chop.

Big Winners leave an escape hatch for the small foibles of friends they wish to keep by taking the blame themselves. If a friend gets lost and is an hour late arriving at your house, tell her ‘Those directions I gave you were terrible.’ He breaks your Limoges bowl? ‘Oh I shouldn’t have left it in such a precarious position.’ It’s the old mea culpa routine that endears you to everyone, especially when they realize it wasn’t your fault.

Your inner Captain coordinates your Dreamer, Thinker, Lover, and Warrior. Most important, your Captain appreciates that each of the Big Four has its own interests and priorities. Each one represents a part of you that cares about meeting your needs. But they value different things, and they define what you need differently. The Lover seeks to satisfy your drive for relationship. The Warrior looks after your need for protection, and achievement. Each inner negotiator falls prey to something that Anaïs Nin observed: “We see the world not as it is, we see the world as we are.”

For successful design: Structure: plan exercises in small teams to allow the topic to be approached from different angles by different groups of people. Diversity: invite a range of participants to make sure you have a team with diverse genders, backgrounds, opinions and ethnicities. Stimulus: create inspiration from new or unusual sources to bring topics to life or stimulate thinking beyond the obvious.

Focus: consider how to keep people focused and thinking deeply by being careful not to overwhelm them with information and keeping outside distractions (such as emails or phone calls) to a minimum. Behaviour: encourage positive, constructive behaviours such as conversational turn taking within the workshop. Conflict: plan for constructive conflict, polarised views and challenges as a healthy process to create ideas.

Let people contribute as early as possible. If you have time and the group is not too large, it is always worth letting them introduce themselves to give everyone a voice at the start of the session, so that they are contributing immediately. I often ask what they would like the workshop to achieve and write down these points to refer to at the end of the workshop, to see if we managed to achieve them. Give positive feedback. When people are sharing ideas, even if you are listening intently, do not stay quiet. Sharing ideas can be scary for the person who is talking, and the workshop leader should be as encouraging as possible with everyone and every idea. Keep giving positive verbal feedback throughout, saying ‘yes’, ‘great idea’, ‘well done’, ‘that’s good!’, etc. This keeps up the momentum as it interrupts monologues and helps people move onto the next point, and it allows you to politely interrupt people when they’ve talked for too long,

with phrases like ‘thank you’ and ‘great’ said in a tone of finishing and moving on. Reflect on ideas. A way to make people feel really good about their ideas is to reflect on them, saying something like ‘I really like that idea because…’ or ‘that makes me think of a new idea such as…’ Be polite. Keep your tone calm, kind and friendly. Don’t shout over the group for any reason. Be an example with your own mood, tone and demeanour. Be confident, calm, positive and energetic, and people will reflect this back to you. Listen but don’t interfere in breakout groups. Listen and check in with them to see if they have the information they need and are clear on the task, but don’t interfere in breakout discussions unless invited to do so by the team. It can worry people and distract them if they feel they are being watched or interrupted.

Don’t panic people. Try not to put people under pressure, even if you do need to keep to time. Instead of saying ‘you’ve got five minutes left!’, talk to each group in turn, gently asking if they are ready to move on and explaining there are about five minutes left for this task. Focus your words on what you want people to do (rather than what you don’t want them to do). Give reasons for each instruction so people understand why they are being asked to do something in a certain way. Close the session by asking for one comment from each person before they go, for example something they feel has been achieved in the session, or something they are still concerned about. This helps encourage people to share something positive in front of each other (which reminds everyone that they have used their time wisely), but also allows them to express concerns openly (instead of grumbling afterwards).

Is this a special format or file type better handled by a dedicated app? Although you could save specialized files such as Photoshop files or video footage in your notes, you’ll need a specialized app to open them anyway, so there’s no benefit to keeping them in your notes. Is this a very large file? Notes apps are made for short, lightweight bits of text and images, and their performance will often be severely hampered if you try to save large files in them. Will it need to be collaboratively edited? Notes apps are perfectly suited for individual, private use, which makes them less than ideal for collaboration. You can share individual notes or even groups of notes with others, but if you need multiple people to be able to collaboratively edit a document in real time, then you’ll need to use a different platform.

Communicate with stakeholders: Notify your manager, colleagues, clients, customers, shareholders, contractors, etc., that the project is complete and what the outcomes were. Evaluate success criteria: Were the objectives of the project achieved? Why or why not? What was the return on investment? Officially close out the project and celebrate: Send any last emails, invoices, receipts, feedback forms, or documents, and celebrate your accomplishments with your team or collaborators so you receive the feeling of fulfillment for all the effort you put in.

Getting Things Done.* He described a Weekly Review as a regular check-in, performed once a week, in which you intentionally reset and review your work and life. Allen recommends using a Weekly Review to write down any new to-dos, review your active projects, and decide on priorities for the upcoming week. I suggest adding one more step: review the notes you’ve created over the past week, give them succinct titles that tell you what’s inside, and sort them into the appropriate PARA folders. Most notes apps have an “inbox” of some kind where new notes collect until they’re ready to be reviewed.

1. Review and update my goals. I start by reviewing my goals for the quarter and the year. I ask myself questions like “What successes or accomplishments did I have?” and “What went unexpectedly and what can I learn from it?” I’ll take some time to cross off any completed goals, add any new ones that have emerged, or change the scope of goals that no longer make sense.

Timing: Make sure you know what you want a Master for and if you need it right now. If you don’t have a clear reason to do a Master now, why not postpone the decision to a later stage? Content: Make sure you know what kind of knowledge you want to build through a Master. If you need in-depth knowledge now, why do a general management Master? Teaching mode: Assess what’s the best teaching mode for you. If you don’t want give up your job why not do a part-time program? Career goals: Take the time to clearly reflect on your career goals. Which benefits does a Master need to provide you with to maximize your satisfaction? Career benefits: Search only for programs that match your career goals. Do you really need a huge alumni network or is your primary interest rather the reputation of the title or school? If you want to become an investment banker, why not choose a program where investment banks recruit? Resources: Be aware of your resources and search for programs for which they are sufficient – or increase your resources. If you are primarily interested in gaining business competence, why pay for a top-ranked program that charges you for its reputation or network services? Experience goals: Perceive a Business Master as more than just a means to advance your career. By reflecting on your experience preferences, you have another tool to select a Master that sMSIDfies you. Experience benefits: After having selected your list of ideal programs according to the above steps, you can now choose the programs that fulfill your experience goals. For example: If you are interested in a different culture, why not study there? Gut feeling: Visit the campus and talk to as many people as possible. If you don’t feel comfortable with a campus, the students, the admissions or career service people, or professors – why then apply for such a program?

nstinctively, we protect our physical selves. We don’t let people touch us, push us around, control where we go. But when it comes to the mind, we’re less disciplined. We hand it over willingly to social media, to television, to what other people are doing, thinking, or saying. We sit down to work and the next thing you know, we’re browsing the Internet. We sit down with our families, but within minutes we have our phones out. We sit down peacefully in a park, but instead of looking inward, we’re judging people as they pass by. We don’t even know that we’re doing this. We don’t realize how much waste is in it, how inefficient and distracted it makes us. And what’s worse—no one is making this happen. It’s totally self-inflicted. To the Stoics, this is an abomination. They know that the world can control our bodies—we can be thrown in jail or be tossed about by the weather. But the mind? That’s ours. We must protect it. Maintain control over your mind and perceptions, they’d say. It’s your most prized possession.

Exercise is by far the most potent longevity “drug.” No other intervention does nearly as much to prolong our lifespan and preserve our cognitive and physical function.

The point is that the tactics are what you do when you are actually in the ring. The strategy is the harder part, because it requires careful study of one’s opponent, identifying his strengths and weaknesses, and figuring out how to use both to your advantage, well before actually stepping in the ring.

intracellular protein complex called mTOR (pronounced “em-tor”), for “mechanistic target of rapamycin.”fn2 Why do we care about mTOR? Because this mechanism turns out to be one of the most important mediators of longevity at the cellular level. Not only that, but it is highly “conserved,”2 meaning it is found in virtually all forms of life, ranging from yeast to flies to worms and right on up to us humans.

The job of mTOR3 is basically to balance an organism’s need to grow and reproduce against the availability of nutrients. When food is plentiful, mTOR is activated and the cell (or the organism) goes into growth mode, producing new proteins and undergoing cell division, as with the ultimate goal of reproduction. When nutrients are scarce, mTOR is suppressed and cells go into a kind of “recycling” mode, breaking down cellular components and generally cleaning house.

AMP-activated protein kinase, or AMPK for short. AMPK is like the low-fuel light on the dashboard of your car: when it senses low levels of nutrients14 (fuel), it activates, triggering a cascade of actions. While this typically happens as a response to lack of nutrients, AMPK is also activated when we exercise, responding to the transient drop in nutrient levels.

AMPK works to inhibit the activity of mTOR, the cellular growth regulator. Specifically, it seems to be a drop in amino acids that induces mTOR to shut down, and with it all the anabolic (growth) processes that mTOR controls. Instead of making new proteins and undergoing cell division, the cell goes into a more fuel-efficient and stress-resistant mode, activating an important cellular recycling process called autophagy, which means “self-eating” (or better yet, “self-devouring”).

An adult male can typically store a total of about 1,600 calories worth of glycogen between these two sites, or about enough energy for two hours of vigorous endurance exercise.

Insulin resistance is a term that we hear a lot, but what does it really mean? Technically, it means that cells, initially muscle cells, have stopped listening to insulin’s signals, but another way to visualize it is to imagine the cell as a balloon being blown up with air. Eventually, the balloon expands to the point where it gets more difficult to force more air inside. You have to blow harder and harder. This is where insulin comes in, to help facilitate the process of blowing air into the balloon. The pancreas begins to secrete even more insulin, to try to remove excess glucose from the bloodstream and cram it into cells. For the time being it works, and blood glucose levels remain normal, but eventually you reach a limit where the “balloon” (cells) cannot accept any more “air” (glucose).

If things continue in this way, then the pancreas becomes fatigued and less able to mount an insulin response. This is made worse by, you guessed it, the fat now residing in the pancreas itself. You can see the vicious spiral forming here: fat spillover helps initiate insulin resistance, which results in the accumulation of still more fat, eventually impairing our ability to store calories as anything other than fat.

There are many other hormones involved in the production and distribution of fat, including testosterone, estrogen, hormone-sensitive lipasefn3 and cortisol. Cortisol is especially potent, with a double-edged effect of depleting subcutaneous fat (which is generally beneficial) and replacing it with more harmful visceral fat.

But insulin seems to be the most potent17 as far as promoting fat accumulation because it acts as kind of a one-way gate, allowing fat to enter the cell while impairing the release of energy from fat cells (via a process called lipolysis). Insulin is all about fat storage, not fat utilization.

The key factor here is that fructose is metabolized in a manner different from other sugars.

Whatever form it takes, fructose does not pose a problem when consumed the way that our ancestors did, before sugar became a ubiquitous commodity: mostly in the form of actual fruit. It is very difficult to get fat from eating too many apples, for example, because the fructose in the apple enters our system relatively slowly, mixed with fiber and water, and our gut and our metabolism can handle it normally.

when we metabolize fructose in large quantities, a different enzyme takes over, and this enzyme does not put the brakes on ATP “spending.”28 Instead, energy (ATP) levels inside the cell drop rapidly and dramatically. This rapid drop in energy levels makes the cell think that we are still hungry. The mechanisms are a bit complicated, but the bottom line is that even though it is rich in energy, fructose basically tricks our metabolism into thinking that we are depleting energy—and need to take in still more food and store more energy as fat.

Cholesterol is essential to life. It is required to produce some of the most important structures in the body, including cell membranes; hormones such as testosterone, progesterone, estrogen, and cortisol; and bile acids, which are necessary for digesting food. All cells can synthesize their own cholesterol, but some 20 percent of our body’s (large) supply is found in the liver, which acts as a sort of cholesterol repository, shipping it out to cells that need it and receiving it back via the circulation. Because cholesterol belongs to the lipid family (that is, fats), it is not water soluble and thus cannot dissolve in our plasma like glucose or sodium and travel freely through our circulation. So it must be carted around in tiny spherical particles called lipoproteins—the final “L” in LDL and HDL—which act like little cargo submarines. As their name suggests, these lipoproteins are part lipid (inside) and part protein (outside); the protein is essentially the vessel that allows them to travel in our plasma while carrying their water-insoluble cargo of lipids, including cholesterol, triglycerides, and phospholipids, plus vitamins and other proteins that need to be distributed to our distant tissues.

The reason they’re called high-and low-density lipoproteins (HDL and LDL, respectively) has to do with the amount of fat relative to protein that each one carries. LDLs carry more lipids, while HDLs carry more protein in relation to fat, and are therefore more dense. Also, these particles (and other lipoproteins) frequently exchange cargo with one another, which is part of what drives me crazy about labeling them “good” and “bad.” When an HDL transfers its “good cholesterol” to an LDL particle, does that cholesterol suddenly become “bad”?

The answer is no—because it’s not the cholesterol per se that causes problems but the nature of the particle in which it’s transported. Each lipoprotein particle is enwrapped by one or more large molecules, called apolipoproteins, that provide structure, stability, and, most importantly solubility to the particle. HDL particles are wrapped in a type of molecule called apolipoprotein A (or apoA), while LDL is encased in apolipoprotein B (or apoB). This distinction may seem trivial, but it goes to the very root cause of atherosclerotic disease: every single lipoprotein that contributes to atherosclerosis—not only LDL but several othersfn1—carries this apoB protein signature.

If you take a healthy coronary artery and expose it to high enough concentrations of apoB particles, over a long enough time, a certain amount of LDL (and VLDL) will get stuck in that subendothelial space and become oxidized, which then leads to it sticking together in clumps or aggregates.

What Is Cancer? One major reason why cancer is so deadly—and so scary—is that we still know relatively little about how it begins and why it spreads. Cancer cells are different from normal cells in two important ways. Contrary to popular belief, cancer cells don’t grow faster than their noncancerous counterparts; they just don’t stop growing when they are supposed to. For some reason, they stop listening to the body’s signals that tell them when to grow and when to stop growing. This process is thought to begin when normal cells acquire certain genetic mutations. For example, a gene called PTEN,5 which normally stops cells from growing or dividing (and eventually becoming tumors), is often mutated or “lost” in people with cancer, including about 31 percent of men with prostate cancer and 70 percent of men with advanced prostate cancer. Such “tumor suppressor” genes are critically important to our understanding of the disease.

The second property that defines cancer cells is their ability to travel from one part of the body to a distant site where they should not be. This is called metastasis, and it is what enables a cancerous cell in the breast to spread to the lung. This spreading is what turns a cancer from a local, manageable problem to a fatal, systemic disease.

These are extremely dense with mitochondria and thus well-suited for slow-paced, efficient endurance work. We can go for a long time without feeling fatigued. If we pick up the pace, we begin to recruit more type 2 (“fast-twitch”) muscle fibers, which are less efficient but more forceful. They also generate more lactate in the process, because of the way they create ATP. Lactate itself is not bad; trained athletes are able to recycle it as a type of fuel.

VO2 max efforts are almost the opposite. This is a much higher level of intensity—a hard, minutes-long effort, but still well short of an all-out sprint. At VO2 max, we are using a combination of aerobic and anaerobic pathways to produce energy, but we are at our maximum rate of oxygen consumption.

VO2 max intervals are a bit longer, ranging from three to eight minutes—and a notch less intense. I do these workouts on my road bike, mounted to a stationary trainer, or on a rowing machine, but running on a treadmill (or a track) could also work. The tried-and-true formula for these intervals is to go four minutes at the maximum pace you can sustain for this amount of time—not an all-out sprint, but still a very hard effort. Then ride or jog four minutes easy, which should be enough time for your heart rate to come back down to below about one hundred beats per minute. Repeat this four to six times and cool down.

we lose muscle strength about two to three times more quickly than we lose muscle mass. And we lose power (strength × speed) two to three times faster than we lose strength. This is because the biggest single change in the aging muscle is the atrophy of our fast twitch or type 2 muscle fibers. Ergo, our training must be geared towards improving these with heavy resistance training. Daily life and zone 2 endurance work may be enough to prevent atrophy of type 1 fibers—but unless you are working against significant resistance, your type 2 muscle fibers will wither away.

Here’s another quick exercise to help you understand how to create IAP: breathe all the way in, so you feel as if you are inflating the cylinder on all sides and pulling air all the way down into your pelvic floor, the bottom of the cylinder. You’re not actually “breathing” there, in the sense that air is actually entering your pelvis; you’re seeking maximal lung expansion, which in turn sort of pushes your diaphragm down. With every inhale, focus on expanding the cylinder around its whole diameter and not merely raising the belly.

There was a simple explanation for this: the mice that were strongest and healthiest had the largest appetites, and thus they ate more. Because they were healthiest to begin with, they also lived the longest. But if all we had to go on was Allison’s epidemiological analysis of this particular subgroup, and not the larger and better-designed clinical trial, we might conclude that eating more calories causes all mice to live longer, which we are pretty certain is not the case.

Another surprising thing I’ve learned thanks to CGM is about what happens to a patient’s glucose levels during the night. If she goes to bed at, say, 80 mg/dL, but then her glucose ramps up to 110 for most of the night, that tells me that she is likely dealing with psychological stress. Stress prompts an elevation in cortisol, which in turn stimulates the liver to drip more glucose into circulation. This tells me that we need to address her stress levels and probably also her sleep quality.

But if you choose to get all your protein from plants, you need to understand two things. First, the protein found in plants is there for the benefit of the plant, which means it is largely tied up in indigestible fiber, and therefore less bioavailable to the person eating it. Because much of the plant’s protein is tied to its roots, leaves, and other structures, only about 60 to 70 percent of what you consume is contributing to your needs,

Putting all these changes into practice typically means eating more olive oil and avocados and nuts, cutting back on (but not necessarily eliminating) things like butter and lard, and reducing the omega-6-rich corn, soybean, and sunflower oils—while also looking for ways to increase high-omega-3 marine PUFAs from sources such as salmon and anchovies.fn12

industrial fat revolution also helped create trans fats, listed on ingredient labels as “partially hydrogenated vegetable oils” (think: margarine), which in turn helped enable the proliferation of the SAD, in part because they allowed foods to remain shelf stable for longer periods. But trans fats also contributed to atherosclerosis (by raising apoB) and have been banned by the FDA.

I’ve come to believe that fasting-based interventions must be utilized carefully and with precision. There is no denying that some good things happen when we are not eating. Insulin drops dramatically because there are no incoming calories to trigger an insulin response. The liver is emptied of fat in fairly short order. Over time, within three days or so, the body enters a state called “starvation ketosis,” where fat stores are mobilized to fulfill the need for energy

Both poor sleep and high stress activate the sympathetic nervous system, which—despite its name—is the opposite of calming. It is part of our fight-or-flight response, prompting the release of hormones called glucocorticoids, including the stress hormone cortisol. Cortisol raises blood pressure; it also causes glucose to be released25 from the liver, while inhibiting the uptake and utilization of glucose in the muscle and fat tissues, perhaps in order to prioritize glucose delivery to the brain. In the body, this manifests as elevated glucose due to stress-induced insulin resistance

A warm bath before bed may actually help with this process, not only because the bath itself is relaxing but also because when we get out of the bath and climb into our cool bed, our core temperature drops, which signals to our brain that it is time to fall asleep.

Everything in my own immediate experience supports my deep belief that I am the absolute center of the universe; the realest, most vivid and important person in existence. We rarely think about this sort of natural, basic self-centeredness because it’s so socially repulsive. But it’s pretty much the same for all of us. It is our default setting, hard-wired into our motherboards at birth. Think about it: there is no experience you have had that you are not the absolute center of. The world as you experience it is there in front of YOU or behind YOU, to the left or right of YOU, on YOUR TV or YOUR monitor. And so on. Other people’s thoughts and feelings have to be communicated to you somehow, but your own are so immediate, urgent, real.
